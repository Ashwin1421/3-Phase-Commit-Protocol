# 3 Phase Commit Protocol in Distributed Systems
This project is developed to simulate a 3 phase commit protocol between different machines in a distributed environment. The distributed environment comprises of a coordinator process and 4 cohorts.
## Getting started
Clone this project on your local machine to run it.
```
git clone https://github.com/Ashwin1421/3-Phase-Commit-Protocol
```
### Prerequisites
Although there aren't any specific prerequisites, I would recommend using NetBeans to run this project or edit it's configuration to allow it to run on multiple hosts. Then build it and run the jar file on separate hosts.
### Running the program
To run the coordinator process
```
java -jar <App>.jar -c
```
To run a cohort
```
java -jar <App>.jar
```
